HatBot is a custom bot for hack.chat and its forks.

### HatBot comes in 3 **delicious** flavors!

## Flavor One: BASIC

The Basic flavor is just that â€” basic! It only includes the scripts necessary to run and function. No UI included! Good for deploying to a VPS where a UI isn't neccessary, and can save on memory!

## Flavor Two: FEATURE-HEAVY

The Feature-Heavy edition includes and actual UI, with the ability to chat from the bot, view bot statistics (such as the bot's uptime, number of commands issued, errors that may have occurred, and more coming soon), as well as tons of customizable options for the bot itself! More is planned for this verision in the future.

## Flavor Three: COMING SOON

No seriously, coming soon. I'm working on this one.

# Adding more to this repo and readme in the future.

# EXPECTED RELEASE: April 19th, 2017.

Don't hold me to it...
